            <h3>Educhange was founded by two first generation Indian-American citizens when they realized how privileged they had been to be born and raised into a great country with a great family, and most importantly, a great education. <br><br>Anirudh and Neeraj, the collaborators on this project, met at a four week camp in which students immerse themselves in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math classes with professors who are paving the way for change. At the end, students have to come up with a research project and presentation. They decided to make a project that they believe could really make a difference</h3>

          <h3>Tutoring often helps a student earn the grades he/she wants, and/or helps a student learn what he/she wants. Unfortunately, however, many kids do not have the privilege of being able to hire a tutor, and even less have the privilege of being able to even go to a proper school.<br><br>Through Educhange, students who can afford, and even those who cannot, will be able to find the tutors near them whom they need in order to master a subject. It will be completely free for students to look up and find a tutor near them that suits all their needs, but the mentors have to pay a $15 monthly subscription fee in order to be listed as a mentor on the site. </h3>
